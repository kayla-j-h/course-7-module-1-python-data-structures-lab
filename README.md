# Student Data Management System Lab

## Learning Goals

- Utilize **lists, tuples, and sets** to store and manage student records.
- Apply **list comprehensions** and **dictionary comprehensions** for efficient data filtering.
- Use **generator expressions** to process large datasets efficiently.
- Implement **set operations** for tracking unique student attributes.
- Structure a Python application with modular data management techniques.

## Introduction

In this lab, you will build a **Student Data Management System** that allows users to store, filter, and process student records efficiently. The system will enable users to:

- Store and retrieve student information using **lists, tuples, and sets**.
- Filter student data dynamically using **list comprehensions** and **dictionary comprehensions**.
- Process large student datasets efficiently using **generator expressions**.
- Track unique student attributes (e.g., **majors, completed courses**) using **sets**.

This lab will help you apply Python **data structures** to solve real-world problems efficiently and dynamically.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define the Problem

The goal of this lab is to build a **Student Data Management System** that allows users to store, retrieve, and process student records efficiently. The system must provide the following capabilities:

- Manage student records using **lists, tuples, and sets**.
- Filter student data dynamically using **list comprehensions** and **set comprehensions**.
- Process large datasets efficiently using **generator expressions**.
- Track unique student attributes (e.g., completed courses) using **sets**.

The key challenge is to apply **efficient Python data structures** to dynamically handle, filter, and process student information.

### Task 2: Determine the Design

The **Student Data Management System** will be built using structured data handling techniques, including:

- **Lists & Tuples**: Store student data in structured collections.
- **List Comprehensions & Generator Expressions**: Process and filter student records efficiently.
- **Sets**: Track unique student data attributes such as completed courses and enrolled majors.

#### Design Breakdown:

- **Student list storage** using **tuples** and **lists**.
- **Filtering capabilities** using **list comprehensions**.
- **Memory-efficient data handling** with **generator expressions**.
- **Tracking unique attributes** using **sets**.

This structured approach ensures an **efficient, maintainable, and scalable** student data system.

### Task 3: Develop the Code

#### Step 1: Define Student Records using Lists and Tuples

In `student_data.py`, define a list of students as tuples. You can use the example below,
or make up your own student data.

```python
# List of students stored as tuples (ID, Name, Major)
students = [
    (101, "Alice Johnson", "Computer Science"),
    (102, "Bob Smith", "Mathematics"),
    (103, "Charlie Davis", "Physics"),
    (104, "David Wilson", "Computer Science"),
    (105, "Eve Lewis", "Mathematics"),
]
```

#### Step 2: Filtering Students Using List Comprehensions

In `filter.py`, edit the `filter_students_by_major` function to return a filtered list
of students given a major using a list comprehension.

#### Step 3: Displaying Student Data

In `data_processing.py`, edit the `format_student_data` function to return a string for a given student formatted like:

```python
"ID: 10 | Name: Louis Medina | Major: Computer Science"
```

#### Step 4: Displaying All Students' Data

In `data_processing.py`, edit the `display_students` function to loop through all students and print each student's
details using the `format_student_data` function.

#### Step 5: Updating Student Courses Using Set Operations

In `set_operations.py`, edit the `unique_majors` function to return a set of unique student
majors using set comprehension. For example, given a list of students like:

```python
[
    (101, "Miles", "Mathematics"),
    (102, "Laura", "Mathematics"),
    (103, "Benji", "Physics"),
    (104, "Natalia", "Physics"),
    (105, "Nadia", "Mathematics"),
]
```

the `unique_majors` function should return (in no particular order):

```python
{"Mathematics", "Physics"}
```

#### Step 6: Create a Student List Generator by Major

In `data_generator.py`, edit the `student_generator` function to return a generator expression
for all students by major. Example of a generator expression:

```python
(item_to_return for item_in_iterable in iterable if condition)

# more concrete example:
number_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
generator_expression = (n * 2 for n in number_list if n > 3)
```

## Best Practices for Managing Student Data

- **Use comments** to clarify logic.
- **Optimize lookups** with dictionary `.get()` method.
- **Use set operations** for efficient course tracking.
- **Apply generator expressions** for memory efficiency.
- **Update README** to document functionality.

## Conclusion

By mastering **Sequences, List Comprehensions, Generator Expressions, Dictionaries, and Sets**, developers can:

- Optimize **student data storage and retrieval**.
- Enhance **performance using efficient data structures**.
- Improve **scalability using structured data management techniques**.

This lab ensures real-world applicability of Python **data structures** in managing dynamic, scalable, and efficient datasets.
